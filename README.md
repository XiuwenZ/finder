# Community Event Finder
Welcome to the Community Even Finder! This project was part of RTC's Black Wings Hackathon of 2024. It was a pretty big project and we weren't able to get everything that we wanted done, but the concept is there, and we hope to improve on it in the future! 

Our project is focused on being an "EventBrite" or "Meetup" type site, but mostly for community events. Charity events, educational events, non-profit events, and so on are common types that you would find on this site. It aims to connect people with big hearts and organizations with big motivations, resulting in great things for our local communities.

# Stack used
For our frontend, we focused on using React. It was a simple framework that was commonly shared amongst most of our group, and the familiarity made it easier to develop than starting to learn a new framework from scratch.

For our backend, we used Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. We also used the EventBrite API to fill our initial database with some existing events; this was only used to populate the database at this time.
